<h2 align="center">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">I am a passionate React-based front-end developer with a strong commitment to creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications. My journey into web development began after completing my Master's degree in English from the National University of Bangladesh. I previously worked as an OTA Executive at Obeo Limited, where I managed international platforms such as Booking.com, Expedia, Airbnb, MakeMyTrip, and Ctrip, developing my organizational and problem-solving skills.<br><br>Starting with PHP and Laravel, I gained foundational knowledge of full-stack development. However, I quickly realized the pivotal role of JavaScript in modern web development, which led me to focus on mastering React. Today, I specialize in building front-end applications using React and its ecosystem, with a solid understanding of modern tools like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. While I still have some experience with PHP-Laravel, my primary expertise lies in crafting engaging and efficient user interfaces with React.<br><br>I am eager to contribute to innovative projects, continually expand my skills, and make a meaningful impact in the world of web development.</p>
